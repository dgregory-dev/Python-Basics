# Python Basics Repository

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts demonstrating various programming concepts and practical applications. It's designed for beginners to learn Python programming through examples and small projects.

## Repository Contents

1. `Currency_Converter.py`: Converts USD to various other currencies.
2. `Exchange_Rates.py`: Contains exchange rate constants for the Currency Converter.
3. `Hello_World.py`: A simple script that prints "Hello World".
4. `Library_Inventory.py`: Demonstrates object-oriented programming with a library management system.
5. `Movie_Finder.py`: Recommends movies based on user preferences.
6. `Random_Number_Generator.py`: Generates random numbers and demonstrates type conversion.
7. `Student_Grade_Calculator.py`: Calculates student grades and demonstrates various operators.
8. `Student_Record_Mgmt.py`: Illustrates the use of tuples, sets, and frozen sets for managing student records.
9. `User_Profile_Generator.py`: Creates a user profile using string manipulation techniques.
10. `Word_Frequency_Counter.py`: Counts word frequency in a given text using recursion.

## Getting Started

To use this repository, you need to have Python installed on your system. We recommend using Python 3.7 or later.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-basics.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd python-basics
   ```

3. Run any of the Python scripts using:
   ```
   python script_name.py
   ```

## Description of Scripts

### Currency_Converter.py
Converts a given amount in USD to various other currencies (EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD, AUD, CHF). Uses exchange rates defined in `Exchange_Rates.py`.

### Exchange_Rates.py
Contains constants for currency exchange rates. Imported by `Currency_Converter.py`.

### Hello_World.py
A simple script that prints "Hello World". Often used as a first program when learning a new programming language.

### Library_Inventory.py
Implements a basic library management system using object-oriented programming.

### Movie_Finder.py
Recommends movies based on user preferences input through a series of questions.

### Random_Number_Generator.py
Generates random numbers and demonstrates type conversion between integers, floats, and complex numbers.

### Student_Grade_Calculator.py
Calculates a student's grade based on test scores. Demonstrates the use of lists, loops, conditional statements, and various operators.

### Student_Record_Mgmt.py
Illustrates the use of tuples, sets, and frozen sets for managing student records. Demonstrates immutable data structures and set operations.

### User_Profile_Generator.py
Creates a user profile by taking input from the user. Demonstrates string manipulation, formatting, and text alignment.

### Word_Frequency_Counter.py
Counts the frequency of words in a given text. Demonstrates the use of recursion, dictionaries, and string manipulation.

## Learning Points

- Basic Python syntax and printing (`Hello_World.py`)

- Object-Oriented Programming: classes and objects (`Library_Inventory.py`)
- Conditional statements and boolean logic (`Movie_Finder.py`, `Student_Grade_Calculator.py`)
- List operations and lambda functions (`Library_Inventory.py`)
- Random number generation and type conversion (`Random_Number_Generator.py`)
- Tuples, sets, and frozen sets (`Student_Record_Mgmt.py`)
- String manipulation and formatting (`User_Profile_Generator.py`)
- Recursion and dictionaries (`Word_Frequency_Counter.py`)
- Various operators: arithmetic, comparison, logical, bitwise (`Student_Grade_Calculator.py`)
